      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "**Lapse Severity Score**: 8 (Severe - Fatal Evidentiary Gaps)\n\n**Detailed Failures by Department**:\n\n**Police/Investigative**:\n- **3-year delay in lodging the report**: The victim lodged the report in 2024 for an incident alleged to have occurred in 2021, violating procedural norms and weakening the prosecution's case.\n- **Failure to secure independent witnesses**: No independent witnesses (e.g., the jeweler who bought stolen goods) were examined, creating a critical evidentiary gap.\n- **Broken chain of custody for Ex.P10 CD**: The victim did not hand over the CD containing photos, and it was marked subject to objection, rendering it inadmissible.\n- **Tainted confession**: The accused's confession was obtained in custody and is inadmissible under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.\n\n**Forensic/Medical**:\n- **Inconclusive medical evidence**: The medical officer (PW9) could not confirm sexual abuse, contradicting the prosecution's claims of rape.\n- **Improper potency test procedure**: The potency certificate (Ex.P7) lacked requisition details and the accused's written consent, violating proper forensic protocols.\n\n**Prosecution/Legal**:\n- **Failure to examine material witnesses**: Key witnesses like the jeweler who purchased stolen goods were not examined, creating a fatal evidentiary gap.\n- **Over-reliance on inadmissible confession**: The prosecution's case hinged on the accused's confession, which is inadmissible, undermining the entire prosecution strategy.\n\n**Judge's Criticism**:\n- The judge explicitly criticized the 3-year delay in lodging the report and the lack of specific details in the victim's statement (e.g., the accused's deceitful words and forced intercourse).\n- The judge also highlighted the inadmissibility of the accused's confession and the victim's failure to provide corroborating documents (e.g., employment and residence proof).\n\n**Perfect Chain of Evidence**:\n- The prosecution had the victim's statement, medical reports, and the accused's confession. However, the confession was inadmissible, and the medical reports did not substantiate the rape claim. The chain of custody for the CD was broken, and forensic links (e.g., DNA) were missing, leading to the acquittal.",
      "severity_score": 8,
      "score_justification": "The investigation exhibited severe lapses, including a tainted confession (inadmissible under Section 25), broken chain of custody for critical evidence (Ex.P10 CD), and failure to examine material witnesses. These fatal evidentiary gaps, combined with procedural delays, resulted in a Score 8."
