      "section_title": "Judgment at a Glance",
      "content": "1. **Introduction**: This judgment pertains to SC/ST No.3/2021 in the SC/ST Court, R.R. District, addressing allegations under The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (POA) Amendment Act, 2015 (Sections 3(1)(s) and 3(2)(va)) and Section 506 IPC. The accused, Danda Srinivas Rao (A2) and Smt. Danda Shiva Kumari (A3), both OC (Chowday), were accused of caste-based abuse and criminal intimidation against a complainant from the SC-Adi Andhra Mala community.\n\n2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**: The prosecution alleged that the accused abused the complainant in public view using casteist slurs, following a prior stalking case filed by the daughter of the accused. Evidence included testimonies from the complainant, his father, and witnesses (e.g., PW.3, an elder and colony president) who corroborated the abuse. The prosecution emphasized the public nature of the incident and the accused's knowledge of the complainant's caste.\n\n3. **Defense Strategy**: The defense challenged the independence of witnesses, particularly PW.3, citing their long-standing association with the complainant's family. They highlighted typographical errors in the FIR, lack of independent witnesses, and the complainant's criminal antecedents (e.g., prior stalking case) to suggest bias and weaken the prosecution's case.\n\n4. **The Ratio Decidendi**: The court found the accused guilty under Section 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Amendment Act, 2015, which criminalizes caste-based abuse in public view. The court held that the presence of witnesses (even with alleged associations) and the public nature of the incident satisfied statutory requirements. However, the accused were acquitted under Section 3(2)(va) (criminal intimidation) and Section 506 IPC due to insufficient evidence of causing alarm beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n5. **Final Holding**: Accused No.2 & 3 were convicted under Section 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Amendment Act, 2015, and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000 each. They were acquitted of charges under Section 3(2)(va) of the Act and Section 506 IPC. The judgment also set aside any remand period under Section 428 Cr.P.C. and informed the accused of their right to appeal."

      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "### Lapse Severity Score: 5 (Moderate)\n\n### Police/Investigative Failures:\n- **Delayed FIR Registration**: The FIR was registered 6 months after the incident (14-02-2018 to 21-08-2018), potentially affecting evidence collection and witness reliability.\n- **Typographical Errors in CDF**: Errors in the CDF regarding the location of the incident (Column No.5(a)) were noted, though the court deemed them non-fatal.\n- **Failure to Collect CCTV Footage**: Despite the accused's request, CCTV footage from the alleged crime scene was not collected or examined.\n- **No Chain of Custody Issues Reported**: No lapses in chain of custody for seized property were identified.\n\n### Forensic/Medical Failures:\n- **No Forensic/DNA Links**: No DNA or forensic evidence was relevant or collected in this case.\n- **No Medical Reports**: No medical reports were part of the evidence.\n- **No Sample Handling Issues**: No samples were collected or mishandled.\n\n### Prosecution/Legal Failures:\n- **No Suppression of Evidence**: The prosecution did not suppress any evidence; the complainant's criminal antecedents were presented and considered.\n- **No Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**: All relevant witnesses, including the complainant and his family, were examined.\n\n### Judicial Criticism:\n- **No Criticism of Investigating Officer**: The court did not criticize the Investigating Officer or any department.\n\n### Perfect Chain of Evidence:\n- **Credible Witness Testimony**: The court found the testimony of PW.3 (Ramchander Raju) credible despite the defense's argument about his association with the complainant's family.\n- **Rough Sketch and CDF**: These documents provided a clear account of the incident's location and witnesses.\n- **Prosecution Addressed Credibility**: The prosecution acknowledged the complainant's criminal history, which the court considered in assessing his credibility.\n- **Multiple Witnesses**: The incident was corroborated by multiple witnesses, strengthening the prosecution's case.\n\n### Summary:\nThe investigation had moderate procedural lapses, including delayed FIR registration, documentation errors, and failure to collect CCTV footage. However, the prosecution's evidence, including credible witness testimony and supporting documents, formed a solid chain of evidence sufficient to convict under Section 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Amendment Act, 2015. The court's judgment reflects a balanced consideration of procedural issues without deeming them fatal to the case.",
