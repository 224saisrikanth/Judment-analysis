      "section_title": "Judgment at a Glance",
      "content": "This summary provides a concise overview of the judgment in SCPOCSO No.18 of 2022, dated 29th January 2026, heard in the Special Fast Track Sessions Court for Expeditious Disposal of Rape and POCSO Act Cases, Nalgonda, Telangana.\n\n**1. Introduction**\nThe case involves the prosecution of Kadamanchi Prasad, a 19-year-old accused of harassing and threatening a 16-year-old victim girl, leading to allegations under Section 354(D) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The charges stemmed from claims that Prasad followed the victim for approximately 10 months, proposed marriage, and threatened her, culminating in the victim's attempted suicide.\n\n**2. Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**\nThe prosecution alleged that Prasad harassed the victim by persistently following her, making marriage proposals, and threatening her despite warnings from her parents and caste elders. Key evidence included statements from the victim (PW1), her father (PW2), and mother (PW3), as well as documents like the victim's age certificate and school records. However, during the trial, all three witnesses turned hostile, denying the prosecution's narrative and expressing ignorance of the alleged events. The prosecution also gave up evidence from other witnesses, including police and school officials, further weakening their case.\n\n**3. Defense Strategy**\nThe defense argued that the prosecution failed to establish the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They highlighted the lack of corroborating evidence, the hostile testimonies of the victim and her parents, and the absence of any other incriminating material. The defense emphasized that the prosecution's reliance on unreliable witness statements and the collapse of their evidence base rendered the case untenable.\n\n**4. The Ratio Decidendi**\nThe court held that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proof. The key legal principle was that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution's case collapsed due to the hostile witnesses and lack of supporting evidence, leading the court to conclude that the accused could not be convicted under the charges of harassment and threats.\n\n**5. Final Holding**\nThe accused, Kadamanchi Prasad, was acquitted of the charges under Section 354(D) IPC and Section 12 POCSO Act. The judgment was passed under Section 235(1) CrPC. Bail bonds, if any, were ordered to be canceled after six months as per Section 437-A CrPC. The court emphasized that the prosecution's failure to substantiate the allegations beyond reasonable doubt necessitated the acquittal."

    "Investigation Quality Audit": {
      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "The investigation exhibits significant procedural and evidentiary lapses, particularly in forensic and prosecutorial domains, leading to a critical failure in establishing the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.",
      "severity_score": 8,
      "score_justification": "The investigation is marked by severe lapses in forensic evidence collection and witness management, compounded by prosecutorial failures to cross-examine witnesses effectively and secure corroborative evidence. The absence of DNA links, viscera analysis, or other forensic confirmations, alongside the prosecution's inability to sustain witness testimonies, underscores a systemic failure in evidentiary preparation, warranting a severe severity score of 8. The judge's criticism of the prosecution's cross-examination efforts further highlights procedural inadequacies, though no explicit censure of the Investigating Officer is noted. The case lacks a 'Perfect Chain of Evidence' due to reliance on hostile witnesses and absence of forensic corroboration, leading to the acquittal. The investigation's failure to secure critical forensic links and witness testimonies constitutes a fatal evidentiary gap, aligning with the rubric's severe category (Score 7-8)."
