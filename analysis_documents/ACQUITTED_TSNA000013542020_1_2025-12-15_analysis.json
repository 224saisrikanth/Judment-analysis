      "content": "**Judgment at a Glance Summary**  \n\n**1. Introduction**  \nThis judgment pertains to **SESSIONS CASE No. 162 of 2020**, involving charges under Sections 342, 324, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 3(1)(r)(s) and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (POA) Amendment Act, 2015. The accused, Dr. Vijayalaxmi (No.1) and Garlapati Andalu (No.2), were accused of wrongfully confining, injuring, threatening, and abusing Jillapelli Sunitha (the complainant) in a caste-based context.  \n\n**2. Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**  \nThe prosecution alleged that:  \n- Dr. Vijayalaxmi (No.1) forcibly confined Sunitha in a hospital room, inflicted injuries using needles, threatened her with acid and death, and verbally abused her using caste slurs (\"Madiga Lanjamunda\").  \n- The accused acted in a public place (hospital) and intended to humiliate Sunitha, a Scheduled Caste (SC) member, as per the SC/ST (POA) Act.  \n- Evidence included Sunitha’s report (Ex.P1), witness testimonies (Pw1–Pw14), medical reports (Ex.P11), and caste certificates (Ex.P12, Ex.P13).  \n\n**3. Defense Strategy**  \nThe defense challenged the prosecution’s case by:  \n- Arguing Sunitha’s alleged SC status was unverified (no SC certificate issued by competent authority).  \n- Contending the alleged offense occurred in a private room (not \"public view\") and lacked caste-based intent.  \n- Highlighting procedural lapses: 2-day delay in filing the complaint, missing CCTV footage, and lack of material evidence (needles, rope, etc.).  \n- Citing precedents (e.g., *Akkala Rami Reddy v. State of AP*) to assert that SC status requires proof beyond mere self-declaration.  \n\n**4. Ratio Decidendi**  \nThe court held that the prosecution failed to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to:  \n- **Insufficient Evidence**: Witness testimonies were contradictory, self-serving, or lacked corroboration (e.g., Pw2’s hostile testimony, absence of CCTV footage).  \n- **Procedural Deficiencies**: Delays in reporting (2-day gap), unadmissible 65-B certificate (non-compliance with Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act), and failure to recover the complainant’s mobile phone (Ex.P10).  \n- **Legal Misinterpretation**: The alleged offense did not occur in \"public view\" (confined to a private hospital room), and Sunitha’s SC status was unproven.  \n\n**5. Final Holding**  \nBoth accused were **acquitted**:  \n- Dr. Vijayalaxmi (No.1) acquitted under Sections 342, 324, 504, 506 of IPC and Sections 3(1)(r)(s), 3(2)(va) of the SC/ST (POA) Act.  \n- Garlapati Andalu (No.2) acquitted under Section 342 of IPC and Section 3(2)(va) of the SC/ST (POA) Act.  \nThe court emphasized that acquittal stems from the prosecution’s inability to meet the burden of proof, procedural lapses, and lack of material evidence. Bail bonds, if any, were canceled after six months."

Constitutional vs. Criminal Elements**  \nThe case centers on the SC/ST (POA) Amendment Act 2015, a constitutional provision designed to protect Scheduled Castes and Tribes from caste-based discrimination and violence. While the charges include IPC sections (342, 324, 504, 506), the SC/ST (POA) Act is the primary statutory framework, making the **constitutional** category dominant. The prosecution’s failure to establish the accused’s caste status, the public nature of the alleged offense, and procedural lapses (e.g., delay in FIR, lack of material evidence) led to acquittal.  \n\n#### **2. Key Statutory Provisions**  \n- **SC/ST (POA) Act Sections 3(1)(r)(s) & 3(2)(va)**: Require proof of caste-based intimidation/abuse. The prosecution failed to demonstrate that the accused’s actions were motivated by caste, as the complainant’s religious conversion and marital status (Hindu post-Christianity) complicated the caste nexus.  \n- **IPC Sections 342, 324, 504, 506**: The accused were accused of attempted murder, causing hurt, and criminal intimidation. However, conflicting testimonies (e.g., witness Pw2’s contradictory statements) and lack of physical evidence (e.g., medical reports not aligning with alleged injuries) weakened the case.  \n- **Cr.P.C. Sections 235(1) & 437-A**: Acquittal was granted due to insufficient evidence, with bail bonds canceled after six months.  \n\n#### **3. Procedural and Evidentiary Failures**  \n- **Delay in FIR**: The complainant filed the report 2 days after the alleged incident, violating Section 161 Cr.P.C. and undermining credibility.  \n- **Lack of Material Evidence**: No recovery of needles, ropes, or the complainant’s mobile phone (which allegedly contained incriminating recordings) was attempted.  \n- **Medical Evidence**: Injuries described by the complainant (e.g., needle pricks) were not corroborated by the medical officer, who noted inconsistencies (e.g., abrasions vs. puncture wounds).  \n- **Public Place/View**: The alleged offense occurred in a private room, not a public space, failing to meet the SC/ST (POA) Act’s requirement of public visibility.  \n\n#### **4. Key Arguments for Acquittal**  \n- **Caste Nexus**: The complainant’s religious conversion and lack of SC/ST (POA) Act compliance (e.g., no caste certificate) weakened the prosecution’s case.  \n- **Evidence Contradictions**: Witnesses’ testimonies (e.g., Pw2’s conflicting statements) and the absence of CC TV footage or mobile evidence undermined the prosecution’s narrative.  \n- **Procedural Lapses**: Delay in FIR, failure to seize the complainant’s mobile phone, and non-compliance with Section 65-B (evidence of electronic records) were fatal.  \n\n#### **5. Judgment Outcome**  \nBoth accused were acquitted under Section 235(1) Cr.P.C. due to insufficient evidence, procedural errors, and lack of proof of caste-based motivation. The court emphasized the need for corroborative evidence (e.g., caste certificates, medical reports) and adherence to procedural timelines (e.g., FIR filing)."

The judge’s criticism of procedural delays, lack of corroborating evidence, and suppression of material evidence underscores systemic failures.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Lapses by Department**  \n\n#### **1. Police/Investigative Lapses**  \n- **FIR Delay & Lack of Explanation (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - FIR filed on **08.12.2019** for an alleged incident on **06.12.2019** (2-day delay). The prosecution failed to explain this delay, violating Section 157 Cr.P.C. The judge cited *Dashwanth v/s CB* (2025), emphasizing that unexplained delays are fatal.  \n  - FIR lacked the complainant’s (Pwl) signature (Ex.P14), a procedural error under Section 161 Cr.P.C.  \n\n- **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - Eyewitness **Pw2** (Pwl’s colleague) turned hostile, yet the prosecution did not secure independent public witnesses during the search/seizure. The complainant’s testimony was self-serving and contradictory, with Pw2’s statement (Ex.P2) contradicting Pw1’s (Pwl) account.  \n\n- **Broken Chain of Custody (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - The complainant’s mobile phone (Ex.P10), containing alleged evidence (photos, videos, audio), was never seized. The prosecution failed to recover it, despite the complainant admitting to recording the incident.  \n\n- **Improper Crime Scene Documentation (Score: 7/10):**  \n  - Scene of offence panchanama (Ex.P5) conducted in a hospital room, but the rough sketch (Ex.P17) did not align with Pw7’s testimony. No CCTV footage was collected, despite cameras being installed in the hospital.  \n\n- **Failure to Follow Up on Key Witnesses (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - Pw2, the sole eyewitness, was not cross-examined effectively. The prosecution did not pursue her testimony post-acquittal of the accused.  \n\n#### **2. Forensic/Medical Lapses**  \n- **Missing DNA/Forensic Links (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - No DNA evidence was collected or analyzed. The complainant’s injuries (Ex.P11) were deemed non-fresh by the medical officer (Pw10), who admitted abrasions could not result from needles (contradicting the prosecution’s claim of needle injuries).  \n\n- **Improper Sample Handling (Score: 7/10):**  \n  - The complainant’s 65-B certificate (Ex.P10) violated mandatory rules under Section 65-B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act (e.g., no device details, no data extraction timeline).  \n\n- **Inconsistent Medical Evidence (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - Pw10’s examination (Ex.P11) dated **07.12.2014** (likely a typo for 2019) conflicted with the alleged incident date (06.12.2019). The injuries were not fresh, undermining the prosecution’s claim of recent harm.  \n\n#### **3. Prosecution/Legal Lapses**  \n- **Suppression of Evidence (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - The complainant’s mobile (Ex.P10) and CCTV footage were suppressed. The prosecution did not produce these despite their relevance.  \n\n- **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - Pw2’s testimony was not corroborated. The prosecution relied solely on Pwl’s self-serving account, which lacked independent verification.  \n\n- **Failure to Produce Critical Evidence (Score: 8/10):**  \n  - The prosecution did not submit the complainant’s mobile, CCTV footage, or a valid 65-B certificate. The delay in filing the FIR (2 days) was not explained, violating Section 157 Cr.P.C.  \n\n---\n\n### **Judicial Criticism**  \nThe judge explicitly criticized the investigating agency for:  \n- **Delays:** Highlighting the 2-day FIR delay and lack of explanation.  \n- **Procedural Errors:** FIR without complainant’s signature, failure to seize the complainant’s mobile, and improper 65-B certificate.  \n- **Lack of Corroboration:** Reliance on self-serving testimony (Pwl) and hearsay evidence (Pw3–Pw14).  \n\n---\n\n### **Perfect Chain of Evidence?**  \n**No.** The case lacked a coherent evidentiary chain. Key elements (e.g., complainant’s mobile, CCTV footage, fresh injuries) were missing or suppressed. The prosecution’s reliance on contradictory witness statements and hearsay evidence (Pw3–Pw14) failed to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe investigation is marred by severe procedural, forensic, and prosecutorial lapses, justifying the acquittal. The judge’s ruling reflects systemic failures in evidence collection, witness management, and adherence to statutory requirements. The score of **8** aligns with the rubric’s definition of “Severe - Fatal Evidentiary Gaps.”",
