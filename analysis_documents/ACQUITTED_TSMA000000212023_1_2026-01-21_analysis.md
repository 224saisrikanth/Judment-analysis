## Judgment at a Glance
1. **Introduction**: This case involves a rape and sexual assault charge under sections 376(2)(n) of the IPC and section 5(1) r/w 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012, filed by the State of Telangana against the accused, identified as Rekhya Naik, a 27-year-old Lambada driver from Bandameedi Thanda, Keshavapur village. The case was heard by the Fast Track Special Sessions Judge for Expeditious Trial and Disposal of Rape and POCSO Act Cases in Mahabubnagar on 21 January 2026.

2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**: The prosecution alleged that the accused eloped with the victim, a 15-year-old girl studying in NTR Junior College, under the pretext of love and marriage. They claimed the accused sexually assaulted the victim multiple times after taking her to his rented house in Marlu, Sheshadrinagar. Evidence included the victim's and her mother's testimonies, police reports, medical examination reports, and forensic analysis, though the latter did not find conclusive evidence of sexual assault.

3. **Defense Strategy**: The defense argued that the victim and her mother turned hostile during the trial, providing no support for the prosecution's case. They highlighted the lack of physical evidence and the accused's denial of all allegations, emphasizing that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

4. **The Ratio Decidendi**: The court held that the prosecution did not meet the burden of proof required to establish the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The hostile testimonies of the victim and her mother, coupled with insufficient corroborating evidence, led to the conclusion that the case against the accused was not substantiated.

5. **Final Holding**: The accused was acquitted under section 235(1) Cr.P.C. The bail bonds were to be canceled after the appeal period under section 437 Cr.P.C., and unmarked non-valuable case properties were to be destroyed post-appeal period.

## Investigation Quality Audit
> **Lapse Severity Score: 7/10 (🟠 SEVERE)**
> **Justification:** The investigation exhibited severe lapses, including the failure to record material witnesses (victim and mother) under Section 161 CrPC and the prosecution's inability to secure their testimony. These procedural and evidentiary gaps, combined with inconclusive forensic reports, led to a fatal breakdown in the case. The score of 7-8 reflects these critical failures, as outlined in the rubric.

### Lapse Severity Score: 7-8 (Severe - Fatal Evidentiary Gaps)

### Detailed Failures by Department:

#### Police/Investigative Department:
- **Failure to Record Victim's Statement**: The victim (PW.2) and her mother (PW.1) were not examined or recorded by the police under Section 161 CrPC, despite being material witnesses. This is a critical procedural lapse, as their testimony was central to the prosecution's case. The court explicitly noted that the prosecution failed to elicit incriminating evidence from them, leading to a fatal evidentiary gap.
- **Inadequate Documentation of Victim's Testimony**: The victim's hostile stance and refusal to cooperate with the police were not properly documented or leveraged during the investigation, weakening the prosecution's position.
- **Voluntary Admission by Accused**: The accused's voluntary admission during interrogation was not effectively documented or used to corroborate other evidence, missing an opportunity to strengthen the case.

#### Forensic/Medical Department:
- **Chain of Custody Concerns**: While the victim was examined medically and FSL reports were obtained, the court noted that the victim was not examined by the police, raising questions about the proper handling and documentation of forensic evidence. The FSL report did not find semen or blood, and the medical report was inconclusive, further weakening the forensic chain.

#### Prosecution/Legal Department:
- **Failure to Secure Material Witnesses**: The prosecution failed to examine the victim (PW.2) and her mother (PW.1), who were crucial witnesses. Their hostile testimony and refusal to cooperate were not effectively countered, leading to a collapse of the prosecution's case.
- **Overreliance on Unreliable Evidence**: The prosecution's case hinged on the victim and her mother's testimony, which was later deemed unreliable. The lack of corroborating evidence (e.g., semen, blood) in the FSL report further undermined their position.

### Judicial Criticism:
- The court did not explicitly criticize the Investigating Officer (IO) or any department. Instead, it focused on the insufficiency of evidence and the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

### Perfect Chain of Evidence:
- **No Perfect Chain**: The absence of the victim's recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC and the lack of conclusive forensic evidence (e.g., semen, blood) created a fatal gap in the chain of evidence. The prosecution's reliance on unreliable witness testimony, without proper documentation or corroboration, led to the acquittal.
