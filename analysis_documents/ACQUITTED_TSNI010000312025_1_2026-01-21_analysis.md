## Judgment at a Glance
**Introduction**: This judgment pertains to Sessions Case No. 2 of 2025, involving the accused Chella Shravan Kumar, charged under Sections 420, 417, and 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for alleged sexual assault, blackmail, and fraud. The case was heard in the Special Sessions Court for Fast Tracking Cases relating to Atrocities against Women in Nizamabad, Telangana. The court acquitted the accused after a detailed examination of evidence and witness testimonies.

**Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**: The prosecution alleged that the accused promised marriage to the victim, engaged in repeated sexual relations, later refused to marry, took her photographs, and blackmailed her by threatening to circulate them. Key evidence included the victim's testimony, corroborated by her parents and alleged caste elders, and call data records suggesting frequent communication between the accused and victim.

**Defense Strategy**: The defense argued that the victim had financial dealings with the accused, including a hand loan, creating a motive for false accusation. They highlighted inconsistencies in witness testimonies, procedural lapses (e.g., delayed medical examination), and lack of forensic evidence (e.g., negative FSL report). The defense also emphasized the accused's medical report showing no sexual incapacity.

**Ratio Decidendi**: The court held that the prosecution failed to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to inconsistent testimonies, lack of corroboration, procedural errors (e.g., 12-hour delay in medical examination), and absence of forensic evidence. The accused's medical report and the negative FSL findings further weakened the prosecution's case, leading to the conclusion that the benefit of doubt must favor the accused.

**Final Holding**: The accused was acquitted under Section 235(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for the charges of Sections 417 and 376(2)(n) IPC. The case property (cell phone) was ordered to be returned to the accused after the appeal period. The judgment underscores the necessity of proof beyond reasonable doubt and adherence to procedural norms in criminal trials.

## Investigation Quality Audit
> **Lapse Severity Score: 9/10 (🔴 CRITICAL)**
> **Justification:** The investigation is marred by critical failures, including a negative FSL report (fatal evidentiary gap), procedural violations in confession and seizure, and the IO's failure to secure the victim's signature in the FIR. The judge's explicit criticism of the IO and the cumulative effect of these lapses justify a score of 9-10, indicating a critical miscarriage of justice.

The investigation exhibits severe lapses, particularly in forensic and procedural aspects, leading to a critical miscarriage of justice. The FSL report, a key evidentiary component, failed to detect semen or sperm on any of the items (MO1), creating a fatal evidentiary gap (Score 7-8). The accused's potency test, while confirming sexual capability, is irrelevant given the absence of rape evidence. The 12-hour delay in medical examination compromised forensic evidence integrity, violating the chain of custody and allowing potential evidence tampering. The accused's confession, obtained during a seizure panchanama, is tainted by procedural irregularities, including denial by panch witnesses (PW9 and PW10) and lack of corroboration. The IO's failure to obtain the victim's signature in the FIR and inconsistencies in the prosecution's narrative further erode credibility. The judge explicitly criticized the IO for these lapses, aligning with a Lapse Severity Score of 9-10. The cumulative effect of these failures, including procedural violations, tainted confession, and negative forensic evidence, necessitated the acquittal, marking a critical miscarriage of justice.
