## Judgment at a Glance
1. **Introduction**: The case involves Kova Chittu Bai, a 60-year-old woman from Pavanuru Village, Adilabad District, accused under Section 8(b) r/w 20(a)(ii)(B) of the NDPS Act for alleged cultivation of 20 ganja plants on her land. The prosecution, led by the Prohibition & Excise Inspector, Utnoor, based its case on a raid, panchanama (official report), and chemical analysis confirming the plants as ganja.

2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**: The prosecution alleged that the accused cultivated ganja plants among her cotton crops. Key evidence included testimonies from a Village Revenue Officer (VRO), Prohibition & Excise Officers, and a Tahasildar, alongside a panchanama (Ex.P1) and a chemical analysis report (Ex.P5). The prosecution argued that the seized plants were cultivated by the accused on her land, supported by land ownership details provided by the Tahasildar.

3. **Defense Strategy**: The defense highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, particularly the absence of survey numbers in the panchanama (Ex.P1), which made it impossible to confirm the plants were on the accused's land. They also pointed out contradictions in witness testimonies, including the accused's age (60 years) making it unlikely she fled during the raid. The defense cited the Supreme Court case *Alakh Ram vs. Station of U.P.* (2004), emphasizing that mere possession of ganja is insufficient; cultivation by the accused must be proven.

4. **The Ratio Decidendi**: The court held that the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused personally cultivated the ganja plants on her land. The missing survey numbers in the panchanama and inconsistencies in witness statements undermined the prosecution's case. The court emphasized that the NDPS Act requires clear proof of cultivation by the accused, not merely possession.

5. **Final Holding**: The accused was acquitted under Section 235(1) CrPC for the offence under Section 8(b) r/w 20(a)(ii)(B) of the NDPS Act. Bail bonds remain in force for six months under Section 437(A) CrPC, after which they are canceled. The seized ganja samples (MO1) are to be destroyed post-appeal disposal.

## Investigation Quality Audit
> **Lapse Severity Score: 5/10 (🟡 MODERATE)**
> **Justification:** The investigation exhibited moderate procedural lapses, particularly in the Police/Investigative department. The failure to secure independent witnesses and the incomplete panchanama (missing survey number) were significant but not fatal. The chain of custody for forensic evidence (MO1) was maintained, and the lab report provided some evidence. However, the missing survey number in the panchanama was the critical gap that led to the court's conclusion of reasonable doubt. The judge did not explicitly criticize the IO, but the prosecution's case was deemed insufficient due to these procedural failures. The score of 5 reflects these moderate lapses without reaching the severity of severe or critical errors.

### Police/Investigative Department Failures:
- **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses**: The prosecution relied on Pw1 (VRO) and Pw2 (Gazetted Officer), both government officials, rather than independent witnesses. This compromised the credibility of the evidence.
- **Incomplete Crime Scene Documentation**: The panchanama (Ex.P1) lacked critical details, specifically the survey number of the land where ganja was allegedly cultivated. This omission directly undermined the prosecution's ability to link the accused to the land.
- **Failure to Establish Chain of Custody for Evidence**: While the seized samples (MO1) were sent to the lab and returned, the destruction of the ganja plants without proper documentation (e.g., detailed records of the burning process) raises concerns about the integrity of the evidence.
- **Inadequate Efforts to Apprehend the Accused**: The investigation failed to arrest the accused, who was absconding at the time of the raid. This hindered the prosecution's ability to gather direct evidence of her involvement.

### Forensic/Medical Department Failures:
- **No Significant Failures**: The lab report (Ex.P5) confirming the samples as ganja was obtained, and the chain of custody for MO1 was maintained. No lapses in forensic procedures were identified.

### Prosecution/Legal Department Failures:
- **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**: The prosecution did not adequately challenge Pw3's testimony regarding land ownership or connect it to the missing survey details in the panchanama.
- **Failure to Suppress Evidence**: No evidence of suppression was found.

### Judge's Criticism:
- The judge did not explicitly criticize the Investigating Officer (IO) or any specific department. However, the judgment highlighted the prosecution's failure to establish the accused's ownership of the land and her direct involvement in cultivation, primarily due to the missing survey number in the panchanama.

### 'Perfect Chain of Evidence' That Saved the Case:
- The lab report (Ex.P5) confirming the samples as ganja provided a critical link. However, the absence of the survey number in the panchanama created a fatal evidentiary gap, preventing the prosecution from proving the accused's ownership and cultivation of the plants beyond reasonable doubt.

### Lapse Severity Score:
- **Score 4-6 (Moderate - Procedural Lapses)**: The investigation suffered from procedural lapses, including incomplete documentation and failure to secure independent witnesses. These issues were significant but not fatal, as the lab report still provided some evidence. The missing survey number in the panchanama was the critical gap that led to acquittal.
