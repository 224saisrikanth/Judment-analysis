    "Investigation Quality Audit": {
      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "The investigation exhibits **Moderate Procedural Lapses (Score 4-6)**, primarily due to the Investigative Department's failure to serve summons and produce accused individuals despite multiple adjournments. The Forensic/Medical Department shows no failures, and the Prosecution/Legal Department's shortcomings stem from the Investigative Department's inaction. The Judge explicitly criticized the Investigating Officer (police) for their reluctance to comply with procedural requirements, which directly contributed to the collapse of the case. No 'Perfect Chain of Evidence' exists, as the case was dismissed due to a lack of incriminating material.",
      "severity_score": 5,
      "score_justification": "The Investigative Department's failure to serve summons and produce accused individuals, despite multiple adjournments, constitutes a moderate procedural lapse. The Forensic/Medical Department had no failures, and the Prosecution/Legal Department's inability to proceed was a direct consequence of the Investigative Department's inaction. The Judge's explicit criticism of the Investigating Officer's reluctance to comply with procedural requirements aligns with the rubric's definition of moderate lapses (4-6)."
