## Investigation Quality Audit
> **Lapse Severity Score: 5/10 (🟡 MODERATE)**
> **Justification:** The investigation exhibited moderate procedural lapses, including failure to secure independent witnesses, chain of custody issues, and inadequate explanation of FIR delay. These lapses were significant enough to result in acquittal but did not constitute fatal evidentiary gaps or deliberate misconduct. The court's decision was based on the insufficiency of evidence rather than a malicious investigation.

The investigation into the alleged assault on the complainant by the accused persons under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, exhibited several procedural lapses, primarily in the Police/Investigative and Prosecution/Legal departments. The Forensic/Medical department had no involvement or lapses as no forensic or medical evidence was presented or mishandled.

**Police/Investigative Department**:
- **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses**: The investigation did not include the elders the complainant allegedly met before filing the FIR, despite the complainant's testimony referencing these discussions. This omission left a critical evidentiary gap, as these witnesses could have corroborated or challenged the complainant's account of the incident.
- **Chain of Custody Issues**: The video evidence (Ex.P2) was questioned due to the lack of clarity about the custodian of the mobile phone used to record the statements. The Computer Operator at Bonakal Police Station transmitted the video, but the ACP was not the custodian, leading to doubts about the authenticity of the evidence under Section 162 CrPC.
- **Delay in FIR Registration**: The FIR was registered on 18.03.2020, two days after the incident on 15.03.2020. The prosecution cited the complainant's approach to elders as the reason for the delay, but this was not substantiated by any evidence, and the elders were not examined. The court found this delay inadequately explained, contributing to the insufficiency of the prosecution's case.

**Forensic/Medical Department**:
- No lapses were identified in this department, as no forensic or medical evidence was presented or mishandled in the investigation.

**Prosecution/Legal Department**:
- **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**: The prosecution did not examine the elders the complainant met before filing the FIR, despite their potential relevance to the complainant's testimony. This failure left a critical gap in corroborating the complainant's account.
- **Failure to Challenge Caste Certificates**: The prosecution did not challenge the caste certificates of the accused persons or the complainant, which were presented as evidence. This oversight left the court with unchallenged caste classifications, which were central to the case under the SC/ST (POA) Act.
- **Reliance on Uncorroborated Testimony**: The prosecution's case relied heavily on the complainant's testimony, which contained inconsistencies and was not corroborated by other evidence. The court found these inconsistencies significant enough to doubt the complainant's account.

**Judicial Criticism**:
- The judge did not explicitly criticize the Investigating Officer (IO) or any specific department. However, the judgment highlighted procedural shortcomings in the investigation, particularly the failure to secure independent witnesses and address the delay in FIR registration adequately.

**Perfect Chain of Evidence**:
- The case lacked a 'Perfect Chain of Evidence' due to the reliance on uncorroborated testimony, procedural lapses in witness examination, and chain of custody issues. The verdict was based on the insufficiency of evidence rather than a solid evidentiary foundation.

**Lapse Severity Score**: 5 (Moderate - Procedural Lapses)
- The investigation exhibited moderate procedural lapses, including failure to secure independent witnesses, chain of custody issues, and inadequate explanation of FIR delay. These lapses were significant enough to result in acquittal but did not constitute fatal evidentiary gaps or deliberate misconduct. The court's decision was based on the insufficiency of evidence rather than a malicious investigation.
