      "content": "**Judgment at a Glance Summary**  \n\n**1. Introduction**  \nThis judgment pertains to **CC No.4 of 2025**, a criminal case heard by Sri GRAJA GOPAL, Principal Sessions Judge, Khammam. The case involves two accused, **A1 Paladagu Rangaiah** (a retired Army/FCI security guard) and **A2 Surabhi Suraj Kiran** (Branch Manager of Aabharana Jewellers Gold Scheme), charged under **Section 420 IPC (cheating)** and **Section 5 of the Telangana State Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999 (TSPDFEA)** for allegedly operating an unauthorized gold scheme, collecting deposits, and defaulting on repayments. The prosecution, represented by Inspector A.Shankar, sought conviction, while the accused pleaded not guilty.  \n\n**2. Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**  \nThe prosecution alleged that A1 and A2 fraudulently operated a gold scheme under the name \"Aabharana Jewellers\" without government permission, collecting **Rs. 1,56,000** from victims (PW1–PW5) in installments. Key evidence included:  \n- **Witness testimonies** (PW1–PW5): Victims claimed the accused promised bonuses/gold in exchange for deposits, failed to repay, and engaged in political rivalry.  \n- **Documentary evidence**: A receipt book (Ex.P3), confessional statements (Ex.P4), and a receipt book seized from A1 (Ex.P1).  \n- **Police reports**: FIR (Ex.P5), crime details (Ex.P2), and cross-examination of A1 (PW8) admitting political rivalry.  \nThe prosecution argued the accused misappropriated funds and violated TSPDFEA by operating an unauthorized scheme.  \n\n**3. Defense Strategy**  \nThe defense highlighted:  \n- **Insufficient evidence**: No receipts from victims (PW1–PW5) were produced, and the receipt book (Ex.P3) lacked installment details.  \n- **Political interference**: A1, a retired Army officer, claimed victims were coerced into the scheme due to local political rivalries.  \n- **Procedural lapses**: The investigation officer (PW8) admitted to political bias, failed to collect bank statements, and did not establish clear links between the accused and victims.  \n- **Character arguments**: A1’s military background and A2’s employment at FCI were cited to undermine credibility.  \n\n**4. Ratio Decidendi**  \nThe court held that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to:  \n- **Lack of documentary corroboration**: Witness testimonies were unverified, and key documents (e.g., receipts, bank statements) were missing or incomplete.  \n- **Unproven political context**: The defense’s claims of political rivalry were not substantiated by evidence.  \n- **Procedural inadequacies**: The investigation lacked scientific rigor, failing to establish the accused’s direct involvement in the scheme.  \nThe court emphasized that in financial fraud cases, documentary evidence is critical, and its absence invalidates the prosecution’s case.  \n\n**5. Final Holding**  \nBoth accused, A1 and A2, were **acquitted** under **Section 235(1) CrPC** for offenses under **Section 5 TSPDFEA** and **Section 420 IPC**. The bail bonds remain in force for six months. The court dismissed the case due to insufficient evidence and procedural flaws, acquitting the accused of all charges.  \n\n**Key Takeaway**: The judgment underscores the necessity of robust documentary evidence and impartial investigations in financial fraud cases, with acquittal resulting from the prosecution’s inability to meet the burden of proof."

The accused purportedly collected ₹1,56,000 in installments (10 installments from PW1 and 11 installments from PW2–PW5) but failed to refund the amounts or provide gold, leading to allegations of cheating under Section 420 IPC and Section 5 of the Telangana State Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act (TSPDFEA).\n\n- **FIR Registration**:  \n  - **23.10.2024**: The Sub Inspector of Police, Nelakondapally P.S., registered a First Information Report (FIR) under Cr.No.239 of 2024 for offenses under Section 420 IPC and Section 5 of TSPDFEA, based on the complainant’s report (Ex.P5).

    "Investigation Quality Audit": {
      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "# Investigation Quality Audit Report\n\n## Lapse Severity Score: **8** (Severe - Fatal Evidentiary Gaps)\n\n---\n\n### **Police/Investigative Department Lapses**\n1. **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses**:  \n   - The prosecution failed to examine elders from the panchayaths convened by PW1 (defacto complainant) to corroborate the claim of political rivalry. This is a critical procedural lapse under Section 161 CrPC, which mandates the inclusion of independent witnesses during investigations. The judge explicitly criticized this omission, stating, \"PW1 directly transferred the amounts through Phonepay to Aabharana Jewellers and that A1 has transferred the amounts received by him to Aabharana Jewellers and that there is political rivalry in Guvvalagudem village.\" The absence of these witnesses weakened the prosecution’s narrative of coercion or political bias.\n\n2. **Broken Chain of Custody**:  \n   - The receipt book (Ex.P3), seized during the investigation, was not filed with the charge sheet or produced during trial. The Investigation Officer (PW8) admitted, \"he seized receipt book from PW1 at the time of recording confessional statement,\" but failed to ensure its preservation and submission. Additionally, receipts from PW2 to PW5 were collected but never presented, creating a gap in the evidentiary trail. This violates Section 173 CrPC, which requires meticulous documentation of seized items.\n\n3. **Improper Crime Scene Documentation**:  \n   - The receipt book (Ex.P3) did not disclose installment payments as per witness testimonies. The card issued by A1 to PW4, which allegedly recorded payments, was never produced. PW8’s cross-examination revealed, \"the card issued by A1 was given to the police,\" but it was not filed with the charge sheet. This undermines the prosecution’s financial evidence.\n\n4. **Failure to Collect Critical Financial Records**:  \n   - The investigation did not collect bank statements or PhonePay records to verify installment payments. PW1’s testimony about payments via PhonePay was uncorroborated due to the absence of digital records. This is a significant lapse in financial forensics, as per Section 161 CrPC’s requirement for thorough documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Forensic/Medical Department Lapses**\n- **None Identified**:  \n  The case involved financial fraud, not physical evidence. No forensic or medical lapses were applicable or reported in the judgment.\n\n---\n\n### **Prosecution/Legal Department Lapses**\n1. **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**:  \n   - The prosecution did not examine elders from the panchayaths, who were material witnesses to the alleged political rivalry. This is a procedural failure under Section 164 CrPC, which requires the prosecution to present all relevant witnesses.\n\n2. **Suppression/Mishandling of Evidence**:  \n   - The prosecution failed to produce critical documents (receipts, card) despite collecting them. The judge noted, \"the receipt book did not disclose the payment of installments,\" and highlighted the absence of bank statements. This constitutes evidence suppression, violating Section 167 CrPC, which mandates the prosecution to disclose all evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Judicial Criticism**\n- The judge explicitly criticized the Investigating Officer (PW8) for procedural failures:  \n  > \"The Investigation Officer did not take any pain to collect the bank statements of PW1 to PW5 and A1 to show the payment of installment amounts through online ie., through phonepay.\"  \n  > \"This Court has no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused person for any of the charges levelled against him beyond all reasonable doubt.\"  \n  The judge also acknowledged the impact of political rivalry on the investigation, aligning with the rubric’s \"Critical - Miscarriage of Justice\" criteria for judicial censure.\n\n---\n\n### **Perfect Chain of Evidence (Not Applicable)**\n- The case lacked a coherent evidentiary chain. The prosecution’s reliance on incomplete financial records, unproduced documents, and unexamined witnesses resulted in a fatal evidentiary gap. The judge’s acquittal underscores the absence of a \"perfect chain,\" as the evidence was deemed insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
