      "content": "**Judgment at a Glance Summary**  \n\n1. **Introduction**:  \n   This case involves a POCSO Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) trial in the Fast Track Special Judge Court for Rape and POCSO cases in Ranga Reddy District. The accused, Paloju Naveen Chary, a 27-year-old software employee, was charged with multiple offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and POCSO Act, including Section 509 (outraging modesty), Section 354-A(1)(iv) read with 354(3) (sexual harassment), and Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 of POCSO (pertaining to sexual assault and coercion of a minor). The case originated from a complaint by the victim’s mother (Sub-Inspector of Police, Saroornagar) alleging sexual misconduct against a 13-year-old girl.  \n\n2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**:  \n   The prosecution relied on the victim’s mother (PW1) and other witnesses (PW2–PW4) to establish the accused’s guilt. Key allegations included:  \n   - The accused allegedly approached the victim’s family at a restaurant, misbehaved sexually, and forcibly restrained the victim.  \n   - The victim’s mother claimed the accused insulted the minor and outraged her modesty.  \n   - The accused’s confession and breathalyzer test (indicating intoxication) were admitted as evidence.  \n   However, critical gaps included:  \n   - PW1 failed to identify the accused in court.  \n   - PW2 (victim’s sister) and PW3 (aunt) did not corroborate the alleged incident.  \n   - PW4 (the victim) denied any misconduct by the accused and stated no prior police statement was recorded.  \n\n3. **Defense Strategy**:  \n   The defense argued that the prosecution’s evidence was insufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Key points included:  \n   - Lack of direct identification of the accused by witnesses.  \n   - Witnesses’ statements either resiled or failed to link the accused to the alleged acts.  \n   - The accused’s confession was deemed inadmissible without corroborating evidence.  \n   The defense emphasized procedural lapses, such as the absence of a test identification parade despite witnesses being present.  \n\n4. **The Ratio Decidendi**:  \n   The court held that the prosecution failed to establish the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to:  \n   - Inconsistent witness testimonies (e.g., PW1’s failure to identify the accused, PW2/PW3’s lack of incriminating details).  \n   - The victim’s (PW4) denial of the alleged misconduct.  \n   - Procedural errors, including the accused’s intoxication (as per breathalyzer) but no direct evidence of sexual assault.  \n   The court emphasized that the accused’s confession alone could not suffice without corroboration.  \n\n5. **Final Holding**:  \n   The accused was **acquitted** under Section 235(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for offenses under Sections 509, 354-A(1)(iv) read with 354(3) of IPC, and Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 of the POCSO Act. The bail bonds remain valid for six months under Section 437-A Cr.P.C. Additionally, the accused’s Google Pixel smartphone (MO1) was ordered to be confiscated after the appeal period. No sentence was imposed due to acquittal."

      "content": "**Chronological Event Timeline**\n\n- **Date of Incident**:  \n  - **01-06-2024 (1st June 2024)**:  \n    - At **10:00 PM**, the incident occurred. The complainant (Sub-Inspector of Police, Saroornagar, Rachakonda) and her family attended their daughter’s first wedding anniversary celebration. After dinner at Flechazo Kothapet, they waited for a cab. An unknown person approached them, called the daughter “Vastava,” and forcibly pulled the complainant and daughter into a vehicle. The complainant resisted, leading to the accused fleeing. The complainant later lodged a complaint.\n\n- **FIR Date**:  \n  - **02-06-2024 (2nd June 2024)**:  \n    - **02:30 PM**: The complainant’s mother (PW1) filed a First Information Report (FIR) under Cr.No. 449 of 2024, P.S.

Nagar, following a High Court order (ROC No. 346/E1/2022, dated 01-06-2022). The trial began after the charge sheet was filed in 2024, with the accused appearing in court and pleading not guilty. Witnesses (PW1–PW5) were examined, and the accused was cross-examined under Sec. 313 Cr.P.C.\n\n- **Judgment Date**:  \n  - **02-12-2025 (2nd December 2025)**:  \n    - The court acquitted the accused under Section 235(1) Cr.P.C. for offences under Sections 509, 354-A(1)(iv) read with 354(3) IPC, and Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 of the POCSO Act.

      "section_title": "Investigation Quality Audit",
      "content": "# Investigation Quality Audit Report\n\n## Lapse Severity Score: **8** (Severe - Fatal Evidentiary Gaps)\n\n---\n\n### **Police/Investigative Department Lapses**\n1. **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses**:  \n   - The prosecution relied on PWs 1–3 (victim’s mother, sister, and aunt), but PWs 2 and 3 (sister and aunt) **resiled** from the prosecution case, providing no incriminating evidence. The Investigating Officer (IO) failed to secure these witnesses as material evidence, despite their proximity to the alleged incident.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 8 (Severe) – Failure to join independent witnesses critical to establishing the accused’s presence and actions.\n\n2. **No Test Identification Parade (TIP)**:  \n   - The accused was apprehended and confessed, but the IO **did not conduct a TIP** to corroborate the accused’s identity, despite witnesses (PWs 1–3) being present at the scene. This procedural lapse violates Section 161 CrPC requirements for visual identification.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 8 (Severe) – Tainted or absent TIP procedures.\n\n3. **Chain of Custody Issues**:  \n   - The accused’s smartphone (MO1) was seized, but the judgment does not mention forensic analysis, chain of custody documentation, or DNA extraction from the device. This creates a gap in linking the accused to the alleged crime.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 8 (Severe) – Broken chain of custody for seized property.\n\n---\n\n### **Forensic/Medical Department Lapses**\n1. **Missing DNA/Forensic Links**:  \n   - The judgment lacks any reference to DNA analysis, blood group matching, or forensic examination of the accused’s smartphone (MO1). The accused’s BAC test is noted, but no other forensic evidence (e.g., DNA from the victim or scene) is presented.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 8 (Severe) – Missing DNA links and forensic analysis.\n\n2. **Incomplete Medical Reports**:  \n   - The accused’s medical fitness was certified, but there is no mention of the victim’s medical examination (e.g., injuries, sexual assault evidence) or autopsy reports. This undermines the prosecution’s claims of sexual misconduct.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 8 (Severe) – Incomplete medical/forensic documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Prosecution/Legal Department Lapses**\n1. **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**:  \n   - The prosecution did not present PWs 2 and 3 (sister and aunt) as material witnesses, despite their proximity to the alleged incident. Their resiliation (PWs 2–4) was not addressed or corroborated.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 6 (Moderate) – Failure to examine crucial witnesses.\n\n2. **No Defense Evidence Suppression**:  \n   - The prosecution did not suppress any evidence, but the accused’s lack of defense evidence (e.g., alibi, alibi witnesses) was not challenged. The prosecution’s case collapsed due to witness resiliation and lack of forensic support.  \n   - **Rubric Category**: Score 6 (Moderate) – Weak prosecution strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Judge’s Criticism**\n- The judge explicitly criticized the **Investigating Officer** for failing to identify the accused and secure independent witnesses. The judgment states:  \n  > \"the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.\"  \n  > \"the mother of the victim…failed to identify the accused…PWs 2 to 4…completely resiled from the prosecution case.\"  \n- This aligns with **Rubric Category 9-10 (Critical)**, as the investigation was deemed \"miserably\" flawed, leading to acquittal.\n\n---\n\n### **Perfect Chain of Evidence (Absent)**\n- The case lacked a **Perfect Chain of Evidence** due to:  \n  - Witness resiliation (PWs 2–4).  \n  - No TIP or forensic links (DNA, smartphone analysis).  \n  - Incomplete medical/forensic documentation.  \n- The prosecution’s reliance on unreliable witnesses and absence of physical evidence led to the accused’s acquittal.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe investigation exhibited **severe procedural and evidentiary gaps** across all departments, with the **Police/Investigative** and **Forensic/Medical** lapses being most critical. The judge’s explicit criticism of the IO and the prosecution’s failure to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt justify a **Lapse Severity Score of 8**.",
