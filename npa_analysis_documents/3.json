      "content": "**Judgment at a Glance Summary**  \n**Case:** SC No.31 of 2025 (Committal by Smt. T. Durga Rani Kalidindi, Spl. Judicial Magistrate, PCR Adilabad)  \n**Court:** Principal Sessions Court, Adilabad  \n**Judge:** Sri K. Prabhakara Rao  \n**Date:** 24 October 2025  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Introduction**  \nThis case involves three accused individuals charged under Sections 367 (abduction), 313 read with 34 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for accused Nos. 1 and 2, and Section 313 read with 34 IPC for accused No. 3. The prosecution alleged that the accused forcibly detained the victim (PW1), coerced her into aborting her pregnancy, and facilitated the abortion through medical intervention. The accused were tried under section 235(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for the alleged offenses.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**  \n- **Key Allegations:**  \n  - Accused Nos. 1 (Kodapa Sathish) and 2 (Kodapa Pooja) abducted the victim (PW1, Naitham Roja), a 23-year-old woman from the Vadla caste, and detained her for 5 days.  \n  - They allegedly forced her to abort her pregnancy to enable a second marriage, using coercion and financial incentives (Rs. 25,000) to persuade accused No. 3 (Dr. Bakawad Balaji, a medical professional) to perform the abortion.  \n  - The prosecution relied on testimonies from PW1, her husband (PW2), and mother (PW3), as well as medical records and confessions from the accused.  \n  - The victim’s pregnancy and subsequent hospitalization at Balaji Hospital (accused No. 3’s facility) were central to the case.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Defense Strategy**  \n- **Main Arguments:**  \n  - **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the reliability of PW2 (victim’s husband) and PW3 (mother), citing their strained relationship with the accused and lack of corroborating evidence.  \n  - **Medical Evidence:** The prosecution’s case hinged on the alleged abortion, but the defense highlighted the medical report (Ex.P10) showing no signs of pregnancy termination or physical injuries.  \n  - **Victim’s Testimony:** The defense argued that PW1’s statements were inconsistent, and her cross-examination yielded no substantive evidence.  \n  - **Caste and Tribal Dynamics:** The accused’s Gond ST identity and the victim’s Vadla caste were cited to question potential bias in testimonies.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **The Ratio Decidendi**  \nThe court held that the prosecution failed to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to:  \n- **Insufficient Evidence:** The medical report (Ex.P10) contradicted the alleged abortion, showing no products of conception or physical trauma.  \n- **Unreliable Witnesses:** PW2 and PW3’s testimonies lacked credibility, and PW1’s cross-examination revealed no substantive claims.  \n- **Lack of Corroboration:** The accused’s confessions were deemed inadmissible due to coercion and lack of supporting evidence.  \n- **Procedural Gaps:** The prosecution failed to link the accused’s actions directly to the alleged offenses, particularly the abortion.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Final Holding**  \n- **Accused Nos. 1 and 2:** Acquitted under Sections 367 and 313 read with 34 IPC.  \n- **Accused No. 3:** Acquitted under Section 313 read with 34 IPC.  \n- **Sentence:** Acquittal under section 235(1) of CrPC.  \n- **Bail:** Bail bonds for all accused remain in force for six months under section 437-A CrPC.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**  \n- **Burden of Proof:** Prosecution must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  \n- **Credibility of Evidence:** Medical reports and witness reliability are critical in criminal trials.  \n- **Section 235(1) CrPC:** Allows acquittal if evidence is insufficient.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The court acquitted all accused due to lack of conclusive evidence, particularly the medical report contradicting the alleged abortion. The case underscores the importance of corroborative evidence and the limitations of witness testimonies in criminal proceedings."

The prosecution argued that the accused forced the victim (PW1) to abort her pregnancy and facilitated the act through medical intervention.  \n- **Key Evidence**:  \n  - **Medical Evidence**: The histopathology report (Ex.P10) indicated no evidence of abortion, undermining the prosecution’s case.  \n  - **Witness Testimony**: PW2 (victim’s husband) and PW3 (mother-in-law) were pivotal witnesses, but their testimony was deemed unreliable due to lack of corroboration and potential bias.  \n- **Court’s Rationale**: The court acquitted the accused due to insufficient evidence, particularly the lack of medical proof of abortion and unreliable witness testimony. The defense’s argument that the prosecution’s case hinged on uncorroborated claims was upheld.  \n- **Procedural Aspects**: The case was framed under Sections 367, 313 r/w 34 IPC and acquitted under Section 235(1) CrPC. Bail bonds under Section 437-A were maintained for six months.  \n\nThis judgment highlights the critical role of corroborative evidence in criminal trials and underscores the judiciary’s emphasis on “beyond reasonable doubt” in securing convictions."

      "content": "**Investigation Quality Audit Report**  \n**Case:** SC.No.31 of 2025  \n**Judgment Date:** 24th October 2025  \n**Court:** Principal Sessions Judge, Adilabad  \n\n---\n\n### **Lapse Severity Score: 2 (Low - Minor Irregularities)**  \nThe investigation exhibited minor procedural lapses but maintained a credible core chain of evidence. The court’s acquittal was based on insufficient evidence, not investigative errors.  \n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Lapse Analysis**  \n\n#### **1. Police/Investigative Department**  \n- **Lapses Identified:**  \n  - **Failure to Secure Independent Witnesses:** The SI (IO) relied on PW1 (victim) and PW2 (husband) for testimony, despite their familial ties to the accused. The court deemed PW2’s testimony unreliable due to \"inimical terms\" with the accused, but the SI did not proactively secure independent corroborative witnesses (e.g., medical staff, neighbors) to validate the abortion claim.  \n  - **Incomplete Crime Scene Documentation:** While CDFs were drafted at three locations, the court did not mention forensic documentation (e.g., blood spatter analysis, DNA sampling) to substantiate the alleged abduction or abortion. The absence of such evidence weakened the prosecution’s case.  \n  - **Delayed Cross-Examination of Key Witnesses:** PW1’s cross-examination yielded no substantive rebuttal to the prosecution’s claims, suggesting the SI may have inadequately prepared the witness or failed to challenge inconsistencies in her testimony.  \n\n- **Impact:** These lapses contributed to the court’s perception of unreliable witness testimony but did not constitute a fatal evidentiary gap.  \n\n#### **2. Forensic/Medical Department**  \n- **Lapses Identified:**  \n  - **Inadequate Forensic Linkage:** The prosecution’s case hinged on the alleged abortion, yet the SI failed to secure critical forensic evidence (e.g., fetal remains, drug traces) to corroborate PW1’s claim. The sole forensic input was Dr. Kranthi’s histopathology report (Ex.P10), which confirmed no abortion. The SI did not pursue additional medical or toxicological tests to challenge this finding.  \n  - **Chain of Custody Concerns:** The judgment does not detail the handling of PW1’s body or medical samples, raising questions about whether proper protocols were followed to preserve evidence integrity.  \n\n- **Impact:** The absence of forensic/DNA links (e.g., drug administration, physical trauma) was pivotal in the court’s decision, but the SI’s failure to collect such evidence was not explicitly criticized.  \n\n#### **3. Prosecution/Legal Department**  \n- **Lapses Identified:**  \n  - **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses:** The prosecution did not challenge PW1’s credibility beyond her cross-examination, nor did it leverage PW3 (mother-in-law) or medical staff to reinforce the abortion claim.  \n  - **Suppression of Forensic Evidence:** The prosecution’s reliance on PW2’s testimony, despite its unreliability, and the lack of forensic counter-evidence (e.g., toxicology reports) suggest a strategic failure to present a cohesive case. However, no evidence of deliberate suppression was found.  \n\n- **Impact:** The prosecution’s inability to substantiate the core allegations (abortion) led to acquittal, but procedural lapses were not deemed criminally culpable.  \n\n---\n\n### **Judge’s Criticism**  \nThe judgment does not explicitly criticize the IO or any department. The acquittal was attributed to \"insufficient evidence\" rather than investigative misconduct.  \n\n---\n\n### **Perfect Chain of Evidence**  \nThe prosecution’s failure to secure forensic/DNA links (e.g., drug administration, physical evidence of abduction) and the reliance on unreliable witness testimony (PW2) were critical. Had the SI collected medical records, toxicology reports, or independent witness testimonies, the case might have been stronger.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The investigation’s minor procedural lapses (e.g., lack of independent witnesses, incomplete forensic collection) contributed to the court’s decision but did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. The Lapse Severity Score of **2** reflects these minor irregularities.",
