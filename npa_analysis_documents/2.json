      "content": "# Judgment at a Glance Summary\n\n## 1. **Introduction**  \nThis judgment pertains to **Criminal Case No. 1109 of 2022** (P.S. Meerpet), presided over by **Smt. M.K. Padmavathi**, Fast Track Special Judge for Trial and Disposal of Rape and POCSO Act Cases, Ranga Reddy District at L.B. Nagar. The case involves **Shantakula Ajay**, a 22-year-old Swiggy delivery boy, accused of **Section 366 (Kidnapping)**, **Section 376(2)(n) (Aggravated Rape)** of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and **Section 5(1) read with Section 6 (Sexual Assault on a Minor)** of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The complainant is the **Assistant Commissioner of Police, Meerpet PS, Rachakonda, Commissionerate**. The accused pleaded not guilty, and the trial culminated in his acquittal.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Prosecution/Plaintiff's Case**  \nThe prosecution alleged that:  \n- The accused abducted the minor victim (aged 16–17) from her parents’ custody, transported her to Bengaluru, confined her, and repeatedly raped her.  \n- Key evidence included:  \n  - **Victim’s (PW1) initial testimony** (later resiled, denying allegations).  \n  - **Aunt’s (PW2) alleged complaint** (denied lodging any complaint; signature on FIR contested).  \n  - **Uncle (PW3) and mother (PW4)** of the victim, who also denied grievances against the accused.  \n  - **Investigating Officer (PW5)**’s testimony, corroborated by forensic reports (semen analysis, age determination) and the accused’s confession.  \n- The prosecution’s case hinged on the accused’s confession and the Investigating Officer’s testimony, as the victim and her family’s testimonies collapsed during cross-examination.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Defense Strategy**  \nThe defense, led by Advocate Ravi Kishore, argued:  \n- The prosecution failed to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to:  \n  - **Resiliation of key witnesses** (victim, aunt, uncle, mother) who denied the allegations.  \n  - **Lack of corroborative evidence** from the victim or her family.  \n  - **Over-reliance on the Investigating Officer’s testimony**, which alone could not substantiate the accused’s guilt.  \n- The defense emphasized procedural lapses (e.g., the aunt’s coerced signature on the FIR) and the absence of material evidence linking the accused to the crime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Ratio Decidendi**  \nThe court’s decision was grounded in the principle that **conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt**, which the prosecution failed to meet due to:  \n- **Inconsistent testimonies** from the victim and her family, who initially supported the complaint but later denied it.  \n- **Insufficient evidence** from the Investigating Officer, whose testimony lacked independent corroboration.  \n- **Procedural irregularities**, such as the aunt’s coerced signature on the complaint, undermining the case’s foundation.  \nThe court held that the prosecution’s case collapsed due to the absence of credible, consistent evidence directly linking the accused to the alleged offences.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Final Holding**  \n- **Acquittal**: The accused, Shantakula Ajay, was acquitted under **Section 235(1) of the CrPC** for all charges (Sections 366, 376(2)(n) IPC, and POCSO Act).  \n- **Sentence**:  \n  - Bail bonds remain in force for six months (U/Sec. 437-A Cr.P.C.).  \n  - **Unmarked case property**:  \n    - **Vivo Blue Mobile Phone**: Confiscated and returned to the state post-appeal period.  \n    - **Honda Activa (Bearing No. TS 09 FM 4242)**: Held in interim custody under Crim. P.No. 1522 of 2022, later made absolute.  \n- **Legal Precedent**: The judgment underscores the necessity of corroborative evidence and the inadmissibility of relying solely on Investigating Officer testimony in POCSO/rape cases."

Police/Investigative Department (Score: 8/10)**\n- **FIR Resiliation**:  \n  The complainant (victim’s aunt) lodged the FIR but later denied its contents, admitting only her signature. This **failed to secure independent witnesses** during the search/seizure phase, violating procedural norms.  \n- **Chain of Custody Gaps**:  \n  - Seized scooter (Honda Activa) was given to interim custody, but the mobile phone’s status is unclear. No documentation of its transfer to the state.  \n  - No evidence of a **proper crime scene documentation** at the accused’s residence in Bangalore, where no material evidence was found.  \n- **Confession Reliability**:  \n  The accused’s arrest followed a confession, but the victim and family later denied the allegations. The investigation failed to validate the confession’s authenticity, risking **tainted evidence**.  \n- **Witness Management**:  \n  The prosecution’s reliance on the victim and her family (PWs 1–4) was reckless, given their later resiliation. No effort to secure corroborative witnesses (e.g., delivery boy colleagues, telecom records).  \n\n### **2. Forensic/Medical Department (Score: 3/10)**\n- **DNA/Forensic Links**:  \n  The FSL report confirmed semen/spermatozoa, but the victim’s age (16–17) under POCSO was not contested. However, the court deemed the forensic evidence **insufficient without corroboration**.  \n- **Sample Handling**:  \n  No lapses in sample collection or analysis were noted. The victim’s medical report and potency test were conducted per protocol.  \n\n### **3. Prosecution/Legal Department (Score: 8/10)**\n- **Failure to Examine Material Witnesses**:  \n  The prosecution ignored 18 witnesses (23 total) and focused solely on the victim and her family. No examination of delivery boy colleagues, telecom records, or the accused’s alibi.  \n- **Over-reliance on Flawed Evidence**:  \n  The accused’s confession and FIR were treated as primary evidence, despite their later resiliation. The prosecution failed to challenge inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony.  \n- **Lack of Corroboration**:  \n  No material evidence (e.g., CCTV, financial records) was presented to link the accused to the alleged marriage or assault.  \n\n---\n\n## Judicial Criticism\nThe court explicitly criticized the prosecution’s strategy:  \n> “The prosecution case collapsed when its star witnesses… denied the allegations.”  \n> “The testimony of PW5 (IO) is insufficient to connect the accused with the alleged offences.”  \n\n---\n\n## ‘Perfect Chain of Evidence’ Analysis\nThe case lacked a **credible chain of evidence**:  \n- **Omission**: No independent witnesses, CCTV, or financial records.  \n- **Breaks**: FIR resiliation, unreliable confession, and uncorroborated forensic reports.  \n- **Result**: The prosecution’s failure to secure material evidence (e.g., marriage documents, telecom logs) led to acquittal.  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nThe investigation suffered **severe procedural lapses** in witness management, chain of custody, and evidence corroboration. The prosecution’s reliance on flawed testimony and lack of material evidence resulted in a **critical miscarriage of justice** (Score 8/10). The court’s acquittal underscores systemic failures in upholding the presumption of innocence.",
